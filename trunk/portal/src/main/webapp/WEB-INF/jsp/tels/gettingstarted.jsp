<li>Select &quot;Teacher Account&quot;</li>

<li>Fill in the form (and make sure to write down/remember your
password)</li>

<li>Note that WISE teacher usernames does not have a space between
first and last name in WISE 4 (KathySmith, for example)</li>

</ol>

<h3>Setting up a new project run</h3>

<ol>
<li>Log in to WISE 4 with your new account</li>

<li>From the "Projects" menu select "Browse TELS Projects"</li>

<li>You may then select &quot;Preview&quot; or &quot;Set up Project Run&quot; for any project of interest to you.</li>

<li>After selecting "Set up a Project Run", click &quot;Next&quot;</li>

<li>Archive existing projects (optional), click &quot;Next&quot;</li>

<li>Select the periods you will be running the project, click "Next"</li>

<li>"Configure the Run" for general classroom runs we suggest you have
students work in pairs and use the "Low" Post Level, click &quot;Next&quot;</li>

<li>We strongly recommend that you both preview the project and review any lesson plans before using the project with students, click &quot;Done&quot;</li>

<li>The new project run has been created and now shows up under &quot;My Project Runs&quot;</li>

<li>Note: The "Access Code" for this project
run is shown on the confirmation page. Write this code down, as you will need
to give the code to your students when they start the project. (You can also
review all of your student codes at any time in the &quot;My Projects&quot;
area.)</li>

</ol>



<h3>Setting up a test student Account</h3>

<ol>
<li>It is strongly recommended that you create a test student
account so that you are familiar with the process you will be leading your
students through when they start a project run.</li>

<li>Click on the WISE logo in the top left corner (or go to WISE 4
home page)</li>

<li>Click on &quot;Create WISE Account&quot; and choose &quot;Student
Account&quot;</li>

<li>Fill out the form, entering the student code you just created,
and click &quot;Submit&quot;</li>

<li>Note that student usernames take the form of first name, followed
by last initial, followed by birth month and date (JohnB0210, for example)</li>

<li>We hope that students will find this easy
to remember and will use their WISE 4 usernames for all the WISE projects they
participate in in the future</li>

<li>Note that using the student code associates the student with that
specific project run (rather than the teacher, as in WISE 2)</li>

<li>This will allow students to use a single
username and password for all the WISE projects they run, no matter which
teacher or class they are in</li>

<li>After logging in as a student, you are presented with the WISE 4 student homepage</li>

<li>Feel free to explore the project from the student's perspective by clicking on "Run Project"</li>
</ol>
