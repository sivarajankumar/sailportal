/**
 * Interface representing the identity of an individual domain object instance.
 *
 * <P>
 * It should be noted that <code>AclObjectIdentity</code> instances are created
 * in various locations throughout the package. As
 * <code>AclObjectIdentity</code>s are used as the key for caching, it is
 * essential that implementations provide methods so that object-equality
 * rather than reference-equality can be relied upon by caches. In other
 * words, a cache can consider two <code>AclObjectIdentity</code>s equal if
 * <code>identity1.equals(identity2)</code>, rather than reference-equality of
 * <code>identity1==identity2</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <P>
 * In practical terms this means you must implement the standard
 * <code>java.lang.Object</code> methods shown below. Depending on your
 * cache's internal structure, you may also need to implement special
 * interfaces such as <code>java.util.Comparator</code> or
 * <code>java.lang.Comparable</code>.
