/**
 * Determines the ACLs that are effective for a given
 * <code>Authentication</code> object.
 *
 * <P>
 * Implementations will vary depending on their ability to interpret the
 * "recipient" object types contained in {@link BasicAclEntry} instances, and
 * how those recipient object types correspond to
 * <code>Authentication</code>-presented principals and granted authorities.
 * </p>
 *
 * <P>
 * Implementations should not filter the resulting ACL list from lower-order
 * permissions. So if a resulting ACL list grants a "read" permission, an
 * "unlimited" permission and a "zero" permission (due to the effective ACLs
 * for different granted authorities held by the <code>Authentication</code>
 * object), all three permissions would be returned as distinct
 * <code>BasicAclEntry</code> instances. It is the responsibility of the
 * relying classes (voters and business methods) to ignore or handle
 * lower-order permissions in a business logic dependent manner.
