/**
 * Decides whether a proxy list presented via CAS is trusted or not.
 *
 * <p>
 * CAS 1.0 allowed services to receive a service ticket and then validate it.
 * CAS 2.0 allows services to receive a service ticket and then validate it
 * with a proxy callback URL. The callback will enable the CAS server to
 * authenticate the service. In doing so the service will receive a
 * proxy-granting ticket and a proxy-granting ticket IOU. The IOU is just an
 * internal record that a proxy-granting ticket is due to be received via the
 * callback URL.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * With a proxy-granting ticket, a service can request the CAS server provides
 * it with a proxy ticket. A proxy ticket is just a service ticket, but the
 * CAS server internally tracks the list (chain) of services used to build the
 * proxy ticket. The proxy ticket is then presented to the target service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If this application is a target service of a proxy ticket, the
 * <code>CasProxyDecider</code> resolves whether or not the proxy list is
 * trusted. Applications should only trust services they allow to impersonate
 * an end user.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If this application is a service that should never accept proxy-granting
 * tickets, the implementation should reject tickets that present a proxy list
 * with any members. If the list has no members, it indicates the CAS server
 * directly authenticated the user (ie there are no services which proxied the
 * user authentication).
 * </p>
