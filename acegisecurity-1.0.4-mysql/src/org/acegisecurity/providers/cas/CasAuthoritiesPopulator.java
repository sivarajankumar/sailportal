/**
 * Populates the <code>UserDetails</code> associated with a CAS authenticated
 * user.
 *
 * <p>
 * CAS does not provide the authorities (roles) granted to a user. It merely
 * authenticates their identity. As the Acegi Security System for Spring needs
 * to know the authorities granted to a user in order to construct a valid
 * <code>Authentication</code> object, implementations of this interface will
 * provide this information.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@link UserDetails} is returned by implementations. The
 * <code>UserDetails</code> must, at minimum, contain the username and
 * <code>GrantedAuthority[]</code> objects applicable to the CAS-authenticated
 * user. Note that Acegi Security ignores the password and enabled/disabled
 * status of the <code>UserDetails</code> because this is
 * authentication-related and should have been enforced by the CAS server. The
 * <code>UserDetails</code> returned by implementations is stored in the
 * generated <code>CasAuthenticationToken</code>, so additional properties
 * such as email addresses, telephone numbers etc can easily be stored.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations should not perform any caching. They will only be called
 * when a refresh is required.
 * </p>
