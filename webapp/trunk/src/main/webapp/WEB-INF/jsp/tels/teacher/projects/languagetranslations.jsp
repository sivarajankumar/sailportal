<h1>WISE Language Translations</h1>

<p>Interested in having your students experience a WISE project in a language other than English? Several WISE projects are
currently available in non-English languages. Search the Project Library for details. In addition, WISE projects can be
translated into virtually any language. If you see an English-only project that you would like to translate, read on.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started:</b> We really love to hear from teachers and academics in foreign nations who are interested in using
WISE projects. Contact us and we can bring our knowledge of English-speaking cultural issues to bear on your translation
efforts. We can also put our technical resources at your disposal and look for ways to establish WISE in your country.</p>

<p><b>Translating a Project:</b> In the My Customized Projects area you can duplicate any WISE library project and customize
it to your language. You can edit each step of a project, translating all text. Remember, however, that outside web pages
linked to a project aren't controlled by the WISE site, and therefore are not always available for translation. You may need
to search for web pages in your language that have similar content. Also, there is always a chance that cultural differences
will need to be taken into account when using a project. If you ask us, we can help address those issues.</p>

<p><b>The WISE Interface:</b> Many of the interface controls and mouse-over tool tips in WISE v3.0 display English words.
These can also be translated by sending a list of requests to the WISE engineering staff.</p>

<p>If you want to get started on a translation or have any other questions, please contact WISE and we would be happy to guide
you through the translation process.</p>
